**INTRODUCTION:**

MediWox is a cloud based, full-stack web application that automates healthcare services like, patient registration, appointment booking, and facilitating doctor-patient coordination. Through the use of AWS services in its overall architecture, MediWox provides the user with a secure, reliable, stackable solution, that is serverless, with the changing goals and needs of modern healthcare systems.

**HOW OUR MEDIWOX WEBSITE USED AWS LAMBDA:**

The *Lambda functions in the Mediwox system* form the core of its cloud-based backend, enabling secure, scalable, and intelligent healthcare operations. The LoginHandler is responsible for authenticating both patients and doctors using their email. If the user’s email is unverified, it leverages Amazon SES to initiate the verification process, ensuring that only authorized users gain access to the platform. Upon successful login, patients can use the AppointmentHandler, which facilitates appointment creation by intelligently matching them with available doctors based on specialty and schedules. Once an appointment is made, the details are stored in DynamoDB, and notifications are triggered via SNS or SES to keep both parties informed. For doctors, the DoctorAppointmentsHandler retrieves and displays all relevant appointments in their dashboard, filtered by date and specialty, helping them manage their daily schedule efficiently. To ensure data reliability and availability, the backupToS3 function periodically exports critical appointment and user data from DynamoDB to Amazon S3. This not only provides a secure backup mechanism for disaster recovery but also enables further analytics and compliance-friendly archiving of healthcare records.

**AWS SERVICES:**

1. Amazon DynamoDB:

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed, serverless NoSQL database, which allows it to provide low-latency performance no matter the scale. It is designed for agile application development with consistent, single-digit millisecond response times and massive workloads while eliminating the need to manage underlying resources.

Role of this service in MediWox: 

It provides the primary database for all user and appointment tracking data.

The following tables are used:

•	Doctors - Doctor name, specialty, availability, experience.

•	Appointments - Appointment entries, issues, assigned doctors. 

Enables fast read/write read and write operations for lookups and bookings.

2. AWS Lambda:

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets run the code in response to events and automatically manage the compute resources. It removes the need for the provisioning or managing servers.

Service Integration in MediWox Architecture:

Triggered when a patient submits an appointment form.

Functionality:

•	Get appointment and issue data from DynamoDB.

•	Filter doctors by specialty.

•	Utilize round-robin to assign a doctor.

•	Check availability.

•	Update Appointments/Doctors tables.

•	Trigger SNS and SES for notifications.

A different scheduled Lambda function does the following:

•	Move old patient records (greater than 1 day old) to Amazon S3.

•	Runs daily with CloudWatch Events.

3. API Gateway:
   
Amazon API Gateway (Short Description)

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that routes HTTP requests to AWS Lambda functions, acting as the entry point for the MediWox backend.

Role in MediWox:

It connects the frontend (React) to backend Lambda functions for login, appointment booking, and doctor dashboards. It also supports CORS and secures communication between components.

Used Endpoints:

    /

     /appointment
  
     POST: Create new appointment (AppointmentHandler)
  
     OPTIONS: CORS support
  
        /appointment/{patientId}
     
        GET: Fetch patient’s appointments
     
        OPTIONS: CORS
     
     /doctor
     
     OPTIONS: CORS
     
       /doctor/{doctorId}
       
       GET: Fetch doctor’s appointments (DoctorAppointmentsHandler)
       
       POST: (Optional) Update doctor data
       
       OPTIONS: CORS
       
    /login
 
    POST: Authenticate user (LoginHandler)
 
    OPTIONS: CORS


4. Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service):
   
Amazon SNS is a fully managed service for sending text (SMS), email and mobile push notifications. It provides a simple and low-cost mechanism to send notifications to users.

Contribution to System functionality:

Post-appointment: Sends SMS notifications to notify.

•	Patients that the doctor has been assigned for the appointment.

•	Doctors that a new patient has been assigned to them.

5. Amazon SES (Simple Email Service):
    
Amazon SES is a cloud-based email service that can use to send transactional, marketing or notification emails. Amazon SES is designed to provide high deliverability and it's easy to integrate with the application.

Role of this service in MediWox:

After a successful appointment:

•	Patient receive an email with all the details of their appointment and doctor assignment.

Creates communication in addition to an SMS, and confirms details in detail.

6. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):
    
Amazon S3 is an object storage service designed to store and retrieve unlimited amounts of data from anywhere. It is known for its durability, scalable storage, and low cost.

Service Utilization in MediWox:

Keep patient data that is inactive and no longer needs to be accessed (older than 1 day). 

A scheduled Lambda function is set to run every 24 hours to: 

•	Read outdated patient records from a Patients table in DynamoDB. 

•	Place them into organized folders within an S3 bucket for archival. 

This provides backup of data, compliance, and efficient storage and retrieval.

7. Amazon CloudWatch Events:
    
Amazon CloudWatch Events allows you to schedule an invocation of any AWS services, such as Lambda, and allows you to schedule or trigger invocations based on rules. You can automate actions within AWS based on a time-based interval in CloudWatch Events, or based on changes to a resource (a rule).

How it is applied in MediWox:

It will trigger the scheduled Lambda function every 24 hours.

It  can facilitate automating:

•	Archiving outdated patient records from DynamoDB to S3.

Helps to facilitate regular back up and cleanup of no intervention.

8. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):
    
AWS IAM is a web service that provides secure control access to AWS services and resources for users. IAM allows for the creation of users, role, and permissions on the principle of "least privilege." 

Functionality:

Roles were created for the Lambda function to obtain access to: 

•	DynamoDB (read/write) 

•	SNS and SES (to send messages) 

•	S3 (putObjects) 

•	API Gateway

8. Overall Workflow
 
MediWox implements a completely serverless cloud-native architecture, which is based on several key AWS services, to improve hospital management practices. The user front end interacts with the Amazon API Gateway acting as a service mesh and returns user requests (for log in, booking, fetching appointments, etc.) to an AWS Lambda functions. The stateless compute service implements the business logic, fetches information from Amazon DynamoDB via the doctors and patients tables, interacts with Amazon SES to send email notifications, including eventually generating an Amazon SNS for SMS messaging. There are a variety of data points concerning appointments that are backed up to Amazon S3, and monitoring will happen via CloudWatch for observability and logging purposes.
